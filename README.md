# Post Writer

## Requirements

Currently it only works on Linux with x11.

**System Requirements**:
- `gedit` - A Gnome Text Editor
- `xdotool`  - X11 automation tool

**Python Dependencies**:
- `pyautogui` GUI automation library
- `pyinstaller` Bundles Python applications into a single executable.

## Installation

You can simply install it with:
**Note** You need to activate a Python environment first.
```bash
chmod +x setup.py
./setup.py
```
That will install `post_writer` in `/usr/bin/post_writer`.
